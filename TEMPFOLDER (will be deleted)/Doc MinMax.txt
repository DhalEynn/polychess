minimax or MinMax algorithm is defined as a rule to minimize the loss for a worst case scenario.
So the goal of the minMax method is to find the best move to play from a given state(our board)
and also the utility related to this move.
We assume that it exists a tree that represents all the possible evolutions of the game for a
given depth. And the we trace back to the root the best move.
To achieve this the question is to know for the actual level which node will give the best move .
This choice is define by the utility related to each node. knowing that the aim of each player is
to maximize it gain, the highest utility is the one chosen. And so on till we reach the root.
The utility is given by a method also named utility. To play its role, it consider which one of the 
player it has to determine the utility. For that it does the difference between his sum of the points
assigned  and his opponent's.
So minMax return the best move given by tourMax. tourMax chose in all the legal 
moves for a given state the one that has the highest utility considering that tourMin is in charge
to do the same for the opponent.
